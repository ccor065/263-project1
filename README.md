This project implements a python computer model to model changes in pressure and CO2 concentrations within a geothermal reservoir.

In order to view relevant graphs to the model, run the main.py script which will run the model and show the relevant graphs.

A list of the most important individual files is as follows:  <br />
--- plot_data.py - plots given data to show certain trends  <br />
--- lpm_model_functions.py - has most of the functions to run the computer model  <br />
--- uncertainty.py - runs and plots parts of the model necessary for uncertainty anaysis  <br />
--- main.py - runs the model and generates all the graphs relevant to the model  <br />
